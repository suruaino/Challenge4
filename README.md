## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### What I learned

I improved my flex skills with css flex property and the use of tailwindcss. I also learned some new javaScript methods like the trim() while working on form validation.

### Continued development

I will want to improve on my use of javaScript in all areas of front-end development while still working and mastering tailwindcss and vanila.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/) - It is my most used resource. I only used others when a concept is confusing.
- [CHATGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me many times when am lost. I really liked it and will will advice those who haven't tried it to please do.
